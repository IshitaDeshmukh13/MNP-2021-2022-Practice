I am interested in joining MNP for many reasons. 
Firstly, I'm eager to work on project that is aimed at bettering the lives of others. 
In addition, I think that prosthetics are an exciting technology to work on. 
I am hoping to learn a lot about what the various types of engineers do so that I can determine what I should major in.
