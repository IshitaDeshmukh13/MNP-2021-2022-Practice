My main reason for applying was being able to help people while also being able to know who I am helping.
I think that making working on each limb based on a person's unique requests will keep projects fun and
interesting. I hope to learn how software development works on a large scale through GitHub as well as just
all the mechanical and electrical components of the arm.
